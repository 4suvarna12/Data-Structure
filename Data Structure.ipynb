They provide efficient ways to manage information based on its characteristics and intended use.\n","Think of them as containers that hold your data and determine how you can interact with it. Different containers are better suited for different types of items.\n","\n","- Strings :-\n","- Characters arranged in an unchangeable order. Consider writing a sentence, a paragraph, or a piece of material.\n","\n","- Lists\n","- Description: Ordered, mutable collections of elements. Think of shopping lists or task lists. Lists can hold items of various data types (numbers, strings, even other lists).\n","\n","- Tuples:\n","- Description: Ordered, immutable collections of elements, similar to lists. However, once created, the items in a tuple cannot be changed. They provide a secure way to store data that shouldn't be modified.\n","\n","- Sets:\n","\n","- Description: Unordered collections of unique elements. The order doesn't matter, and duplicate entries are not allowed. Sets are useful for checking membership (if an item exists) or finding the intersection/difference between sets.\n","\n","- Dictionary\n","\n","\n","- Unordered collections: Elements are not stored in a specific order.\n","- Unique key-value pairs: Each key acts as a unique identifier for retrieving an associated value.\n","- Flexible data: Keys and values can be of various data types (strings, numbers, lists, and even other dictionaries).\n","\n","2.Explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types with examples?\n","\n","-  1) Mutable Data Types:\n","\n","- Objects of mutable data types can be changed after they are created.\n","- When you modify a mutable object, you are changing the object itself in memory.\n","- Variables pointing to the same mutable object will all reflect the changes.\n","- Example - list, dict, set\n","- 2) Immutable Data Types:\n","\n","- Objects of immutable data types cannot be changed after they are created.\n","- If you need to modify an immutable object, a new object with the modified value is created in memory.\n","-  The original object remains unchanged.\n","- Variables pointing to the original immutable object will still point to that original, unchanged object.\n","- Example - int, float, bool, str, tuple, frozenset\n","\n","3.What are the main differences between lists and tuples in Python?\n","\n","- 1) List\n","- Mutable: Elements can be added, removed, or modified after creation.\n","- Defined using square brackets [].\n","- use case like Collections of items that might need to be changed, ordered sequences where modification is expected.\n","- Has more built-in methods for modification (e.g., append(), insert(), remove(), pop(), sort(), reverse()).\n","\n","- 2) Tuple\n","- Immutable: Elements cannot1 be changed, added, or removed after creation.\n","- Defined using parentheses ().\n","- Use case like Representing fixed collections of items, records, or sequences that should not be altered. Used as keys in dictionaries and elements in sets\n","- Has fewer built-in methods, primarily for accessing information (e.g., count(), index()).\n","\n","\n","4.Describe how dictionaries store data?\n","- dictionaries store data as key-value pairs. This means that each data item in a dictionary is associated with a unique identifier called a key. You use this key to access the corresponding value. Think of it like a real-world dictionary where you look up a word (the key) to find its definition (the value).\n","- Dictionaries are mutable, meaning you can add, remove, and modify key-value pairs after the dictionary is created.\n","\n","5.Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python?\n","- 1 . Ensuring Uniqueness of Elements:\n","\n","- Sets automatically enforce uniqueness. If you try to add a duplicate element to a set, it will simply be ignored.\n","\n","- Lists, on the other hand, can contain duplicate elements. If you need a collection where each item appears only once, using a set is a more direct and efficient way to achieve this than manually checking for duplicates in a list.\n","\n","- 2. Oder is not important\n","- Sets are inherently unordered (before Python 3.7) or maintain insertion order (Python 3.7+), but their primary purpose is not to maintain a specific sequence of elements.\n","- If the order of elements is crucial for your task, a list is the more appropriate data structure.\n","\n","- 3.Sets provide built-in, highly optimized methods for common set theory operations:\n","\n","- Union (| or .union()): Combine elements from two sets.\n","- Intersection (& or .intersection()): Find elements common to both sets.\n","- Difference (- or .difference()): Find elements present in the first set but not in the second.\n","- Symmetric Difference (^ or .symmetric_difference()): Find elements present in either set but not in both.\n","\n","\n","6.What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list?\n","- a string is a sequence of characters. It is used to represent textual data. Strings are immutable, meaning that once a string is created, its individual characters cannot be changed. Any operation that appears to modify a string actually creates a new string object.\n","- strings Contains only characters where list Can contain elements of any data type (integers, floats, strings, other lists, etc.)\n","- string is Immutable: Cannot be changed after creation, where list is Mutable: Elements can be added, removed, or modified after creation.\n","\n","7.How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python?\n","- tuples ensure data integrity in Python by:\n","\n","- Preventing modification after creation.\n","- Maintaining the consistency of related data.\n","- Being usable as hashable keys in dictionaries and elements in sets.\n","- Allowing for safe sharing of data without the risk of alteration.\n","- Promoting predictable program behavior.\n","- By choosing tuples when you need to represent fixed collections of data, you leverage their immutability to safeguard the integrity of that information throughout your program.\n","\n","8.What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?\n","- hash table -\n","- A hash table, also known as a hash map, is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, which can map keys to values.\n","\n","- how does it relate to dictionaries in Python-\n","- Python dictionaries (dict) are a prime example of how hash tables are implemented in practice. Internally, Python dictionaries are built using a hash table. This underlying implementation is what gives Python dictionaries their key characteristics and performance:\n","\n","- Key-Value Storage: Just like a hash table, Python dictionaries store data as key-value pairs.\n","- Efficient Lookups: The average time complexity for looking up a value by its key in a Python dictionary is O(1) (constant time). This efficiency is a direct result of the underlying hash table implementation. When you try to access my_dict['key'], Python:\n","- Calculates the hash value of the key 'key'.\n","Uses this hash value to determine the index in the internal hash table where the key (and its associated value) is likely stored.\n","- Retrieves the value from that location (or searches a small linked list or probes nearby slots in case of a collision).\n","- Fast Insertion and Deletion: Similar to lookups, the average time complexity for inserting and deleting key-value pairs in a Python dictionary is also O(1) due to the hash table structure.\n","- Unordered (Before Python 3.7): Prior to Python 3.7, dictionaries did not guarantee any specific order of items. This was because the hash table implementation focuses on efficient key-based access, not on maintaining insertion order. The order in which items appeared could vary based on hash collisions and table resizing.\n","\n","9.Can lists contain different data types in Python?\n","- Yes, lists in Python can absolutely contain different data types. This is one of the flexible and powerful features of Python lists\n","- You can have a single list that holds integers, floats, strings, booleans, and even other lists or tuples, all at the same time\n","\n","10.Explain why strings are immutable in Python?\n","- Strings are immutable in Python for several important reasons, primarily related to efficiency, simplicity, and data integrity.\n","\n","11.What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?\n","- dictionaries offer significant advantages over lists due to their fundamental differences in how they store and access data\n","\n","- you would typically choose a dictionary over a list when:\n","\n","- You need to access data quickly based on a unique identifier (key).\n","- The meaning and organization of your data are naturally represented by key-value pairs.\n","- You perform frequent lookups, insertions, or deletions based on keys.\n","- You need an efficient way to check for the existence of specific identifiers.\n","- You are dealing with sparse data.\n","\n","12.Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list\n","- you would prefer a tuple over a list when:\n","\n","- You need to represent a fixed sequence of items that should not be modified.\n","- You need to use the sequence as a key in a dictionary or an element in a set (requiring hashability).\n","- You want to convey that a collection of items is intended to be treated as a single, immutable entity.\n","- You are returning multiple related values from a function.\n","- You want a slight potential performance or memory advantage for unchanging sequences (though this is often a secondary consideration).\n","- The immutability of tuples provides data integrity and allows them to be used in contexts where mutability would cause problems.\n","-  Lists, on the other hand, are more suitable for dynamic collections where elements might need to be added, removed, or modified.\n","\n","13.How do sets handle duplicate values in Python?\n","- Sets in Python are designed to store only unique elements. When you attempt to add a duplicate value to a set, Python automatically handles it by ignoring the duplicate and the set remains unchanged.\n","- Automatic Duplicate Removal:\n","\n","- When you create a set using curly braces {} or the set() constructor, any duplicate values provided during initialization are automatically discarded.\n","- If you try to add a value to an existing set using the add() method, and that value is already present in the set, the set will not be modified. The add() operation has no effect on the set if the element is already a member.\n","\n","14.How does the “in” keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries?\n","- The in keyword in Python is used to check for membership. However, it operates differently for lists and dictionaries due to their underlying data structures and how they store and organize data:\n","\n","1. Lists:\n","\n","- How it works: When you use value in my_list, Python iterates through each element of my_list sequentially, starting from the beginning, and compares each element to value.\n","- What it checks: It checks if the value is equal to any of the elements present in the list.\n","\n","2. Dictionaries:\n","\n","- How it works: When you use key in my_dict, Python checks if the key exists within the keys of the dictionary. It does not directly check the values.This check is highly efficient because dictionaries use a hash table for their underlying implementation.\n","- What it checks: It checks if the key is present among the keys of the dictionary.\n","\n","15.Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not?\n","\n","- No, you cannot directly modify the elements of a tuple in Python after it has been created.\n","\n","- Explanation:\n","\n","The reason you cannot modify the elements of a tuple is because tuples are immutable data types in Python. Immutability means that once an object is created, its internal state (the values it holds) cannot be changed.\n","\n","16.What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case?\n","\n","- A nested dictionary in Python is a dictionary where the values associated with some keys are themselves dictionaries. This allows you to represent hierarchical or more complex data structures within a single dictionary. You can have dictionaries nested to multiple levels, creating intricate ways to organize information.\n","\n","- Think of it like a dictionary where instead of a simple value (like a string, number, or boolean), you have another dictionary acting as the value for a particular key.\n","\n","- Example:\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"jTBSV8KU8wSO"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["student_data = {\n","    'Alice': {\n","        'age': 20,\n","        'major': 'Computer Science',\n","        'grades': {\n","            'math': 92,\n","            'science': 88,\n","            'english': 79\n","        }\n","    },\n","    'Bob': {\n","        'age': 22,\n","        'major': 'Electrical Engineering',\n","        'grades': {\n","            'math': 85,\n","            'physics': 91,\n","            'history': 76\n","        }\n","    },\n","    'Charlie': {\n","        'age': 21,\n","        'major': 'Biology',\n","        'grades': {\n","            'chemistry': 80,\n","            'biology': 94,\n","            'psychology': 82\n","        }\n","    }\n","}\n","\n","# Accessing data in the nested dictionary:\n","print(student_data['Alice']['age'])             # Output: 20\n","print(student_data['Bob']['grades']['physics'])   # Output: 91\n","print(student_data['Charlie']['major'])         # Output: Biology"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"UJtKvIxeKbHu","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1744044710997,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":29,"user":{"displayName":"Suvarna Patil","userId":"13477488174897047842"}},"outputId":"beffe856-f616-4ded-d9ac-0fe39406d24e"},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["20\n","91\n","Biology\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["18.In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries?\n","- choose lists over dictionaries when:\n","\n","- The order of elements is crucial.\n","- Elements are primarily accessed by their position (index).\n","- Duplicate values are acceptable and order matters.\n","- You mainly need to iterate through the elements.\n","- You need a simple ordered sequence without the need for keys.\n","- The collection needs to be modified after creation.\n","- While dictionaries excel at efficient lookups based on unique keys, lists are the go-to choice for ordered sequences where the position of elements is significant. The best choice depends entirely on the specific requirements of your task and the nature of the data you are working with.\n","\n","19.Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?\n","- dictionaries were considered unordered because they did not guarantee any specific order of items. The order in which you inserted key-value pairs was not necessarily the order in which they would be retrieved or iterated over. The internal storage mechanism (primarily hash tables) was optimized for efficient key-based lookups, insertions, and deletions, not for maintaining insertion order.\n","\n","20.Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval.\n","\n","1. Lists:\n","\n","- Data Retrieval Mechanism: Data in a list is primarily retrieved using its numerical index (position). The indices start from 0 for the first element and go up sequentially.\n","- Efficiency of Retrieval:Accessing by known index: Retrieving an element by its index is very efficient, taking O(1) (constant time). This means the time it takes to access an element at a specific position is the same regardless of the list's size.\n","- Searching by value: If you don't know the index of a specific value and need to find it, you typically have to iterate through the list, comparing each element until you find the target. This has a time complexity of O(n) (linear time), where 'n' is the number of elements in the list. In the worst case, you might have to examine every element.\n","\n","\n","2. Dictionaries:\n","\n","- Data Retrieval Mechanism: Data in a dictionary is retrieved using its unique key. You provide the key, and the dictionary returns the associated value.\n","- Efficiency of Retrieval: Retrieving a value by its key is highly efficient, taking an average of O(1) (constant time). This is because dictionaries use a hash table internally.\n","- The hash function quickly maps the key to a memory location where the value is stored. The size of the dictionary has a minimal impact on the retrieval time (on average).\n","- In the worst case (due to hash collisions), retrieval can degrade to O(n), but this is rare in practice with a good hash function."],"metadata":{"id":"-93PBx3oKm1M"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Practical Questions"],"metadata":{"id":"G11KlJvZMB-6"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# 1)  Write a code to
